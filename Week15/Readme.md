# Assignment 15

### Monocular depth estimation and Mask Generation.

### Dataset Creation.
- Dataset is generated synthetically by placing transparent foreground images over set of backupground images.
- Detailed procedure for creating the dataset is mentioned [here](https://github.com/deepakgowtham/EVA4/blob/master/Week14/Readme.md)
- Dataset download [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aXOUCyBZn8fL2mL037g7TvYvuTsj7rfg)

### Approach 
- [Paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Hu_Visualization_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Monocular_Depth_Estimation_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf) Junjie Hu, Yan Zhang, Takayuki Okatani, "Visualization of Convolutional Neural Networks for Monocular Depth Estimation," ICCV, 2019 was used source
- [Code](https://github.com/JunjH/Visualizing-CNNs-for-monocular-depth-estimation) Corresponding to the same paper was used and customized.
